"""
You have a pot and N ingredients. Each ingredient has a real number parameter called value, and the value of the i-th ingredient (1 <= i <= N) is v(i).

When you put two ingredients in the pot, they will vanish and result in the formation of a new ingredient.
The value of the new ingredient will be (x+y)/2 where x and y are the values of the ingredients consumed, and you can put this ingredient again in the pot.

After you compose ingredients in this way N-1 times, you will end up with one ingredient. Find the maximum possible value of this ingredient.



Input Format

All values in input are integers.

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
v(1) v(2) ... v(N)


Output Format

Print a decimal number (or an integer) representing the maximum possible value of the last ingredient remaining.
