In this excercise you are given a map consisting of 0 and 1. 0 indicates water, and 1 indicates land. If two 1 are adjacent to each other it means they are connected. 
Your task is to count how many islands there are on the map.



Input Format

The first line contains number n, the size of the map. Each of the following n lines contains n-digit string composed of 0s and 1s.



Output Format

One number that indicates the number of islands on the map.
