"""
In this problem you will be given a list of students and their scores for particular tests. 
You have to calculate the average score of each student and the average score for each test.



Input Format

The first line contains an integer N - the number of students.

Then N lines follow. Each line looks like the following:

student_name test_id:score ...

... symbolizes there can be any number of test scores per line (separated by a space).


Sample Input
4
jan a:4 b:3
artur d:2 a:7
karol c:3.5 a:4 d:4 b:5
sylwester eee:4



Constraints

Each student_name will be unique. Each line will have at least one test score. The number of students will be less than 200.
The number of tests will be less than 200. student_name and test_id will be composed only of lowercase english letters. score is a floating point number.



Output Format

First, you have to print, for each student, his student_name and average score separated by a space. The students have to be printed in ascending order by their student_name.

Then you have to print for each test its test_id and average score separated by a space. The tests have to be printed in ascending order by their test_id.
